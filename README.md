- 


## 3h was not enough for me. More to do (or should do):
- more time for grammatically correct english in this README
- dont push to master instead make PR
- export enviroment variable API_KEY (dont use yaml to store passwords or keys)
- endpoints: all endpoints are internal 
- endpoints: create annotation for public resources @PublicEndpoint (or/and use spring gateway)
- more time to think about exceptions, class naming and other...
- docker, docker-compose (run app with docker)
- create RestControllerAdvice 
- start with tests not implementation... 
- more time to think about swagger (description for endpoints)
- different profiles for different enviroments (e.g. for local development is enough to have in-memory db. For dev/test is good to have some real-db or just db running on docker or something else.)
